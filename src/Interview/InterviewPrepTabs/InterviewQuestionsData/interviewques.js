    Question: "Two capacitors are connected in parallel through a switch. C1= 1uF, C2= 0.25uF. Initially the switch is open, C1 is charged to 10V. What happens if we close the switch?",
    Image:circuit1,
    Answer: "The equation for charge is Q=CU After closing the switch the charge will be distributed between the two caps. Since there are no losses in the circuit the amount of charge remains the same: U1C1 + U2C2 = U3(C1+C2) Both caps will share the same voltage potential U3, U3 =  (U1C1+U2C2)/(C1+C2) = (10*1 + 0*0.25)/1+0.25 = 8 U3= 8V "
